## Research interests
I am interested on <u> the co-formation and evolution of star clusters and their host galaxies in a hierarchical galaxy assembly context</u>, with my ultimate goal being to be able to use old, massive stellar cluster populations as near-field cosmological tracers. In particular, I'm interested in:
* The formation of clustered stellar systems over cosmic time, and their interplay with galaxy formation.
* Constraining the physics involved in massive cluster formation, regardless of the cosmic epoch.
* Development of sub-grid models of star formation and feedback in numerical simulations of galaxy formation.
* Expanding our observational knowledge of star cluster populations in galaxy clusters back in time using imaging from the <i>James Webb Space Telescope</i>.
* Mapping the distribution of mass in galaxy clusters using bright star clusters, and exploring constraints for dark matter models.

## Outreach
I am a firm advocate that academia, and the STEM fields, benefit immensely when incorporating a plurality of voices and lifestyles. 
Over the past years I have participated in a variety of outreach activities. The Spanish Astronomical Society organises a <a href='http://www.sea-astronomia.es/comision-mujer-y-astronomia-11-de-febrero#chat' class = 'mrc-hl'>“Chat with a Female Astronomer”</a> program, in which the general public has access to online chats with individual female astronomers from Spain. Thanks to this program, I have engaged with more than a hundred participants since its first annual event in 2019.
Back in 2017, I gave a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFTef4ijY8s' class = 'mrc-hl'>TEDxUniHeidelberg talk</a> on the multi-scale complexity of astrophysical phenomena.
